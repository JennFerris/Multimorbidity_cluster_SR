# Multimorbidity_cluster_SR

This repo contains the wrangled data and code to reproduce analyses in **Ferris, et al. 2025, *Nature Communications*, "A systematic review and meta-analysis of disease clustering in multimorbidity"**

The raw data are available in the figshare database under accession code [10.6084/m9.figshare.28382543](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28382543). 


## Directory structure

### data
The pre-wrangled data needed to reproduce all manuscipt analyses are located in the `/data` folder.   
These files are named with the convention `data_***.csv`

Some of the outputs generated during the meta-analysis are saved in this folder as intermediate files, using the naming convention `results_***.csv`.   
Because certain meta-analytic steps can take several hours to run, these intermediate files allow users to quickly reload previously computed results when returning to analyses.

### code
The code to create manuscript Tables and Figures and replicate meta-analyses is located in the `/code` folder.  
- `00_function.R` functions to accompany analyses
- `MM_SR_meta_analyses.R` perform meta-analytic network and cluster staiblity testing
- `MM_SR_tables_and_figures.R` creates manuscript tables and figures, note that `MM_SR_meta_analyses.R` must be run first to generate results 

### output
This folder contains manuscript figures and tables generated by the `MM_SR_tables_and_figures.R` script (including Supplementary tables and figures)
